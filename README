py4est wraps the p4est functionality for static and dynamic AMR in Python.

The p4est core algorithms are documented in
Carsten Burstedde, Lucas C. Wilcox, and Omar Ghattas:
"p4est: Scalable Algorithms for Parallel Adaptive Mesh Refinement on Forests of
Octrees,"
SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing 33 No. 3 (2011), pages 1103-1133.

The AMR pipeline and the interaction between the mesh and the fields that is
behind the conventions in the py4est module are documented in
Carsten Burstedde, Omar Ghattas, Georg Stadler, Tiankai Tu, and Lucas C.
Wilcox:
"Towards Adaptive Mesh PDE Simulations on Petascale Computers,"
Proceedings of Teragrid '08.
